Bot Brand Guidelines:
Superhero Docs Bot to the rescue!

* Semantic search across documentation
* Identify knowledge pockets or gaps in docs.
* Self-train on conversations in your Discord server

We can add embeds, and randomly select from a series of images.
This along with the random messages adds a large sequence of unique interactions and lets us give the bot a personality.

Some useful sites for making embeds:
